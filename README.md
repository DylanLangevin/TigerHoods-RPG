# TigerHoods-RPG
My first school project ! RPG playable on Terminal, coded in Python



In my first year at HETIC, we had to make a RPG in Python with two classmates, after 2 month learning it. 




In our game, the goal is to beat the final boss, Tiger Hood. In order to beat him you can
-	fight the enemies to get experience and improve skills 
-	explore the map to pick items, that will make you stronger
-	team up with NPC in sight of fighting Tiger Hood
-	buy, sell and trade items on the market



In fact our game is divided into 3 phase :
-	In the first phase is the exploration phase :
You will be assigned a class from the character list : Fox, Monkey, Brown bear, Royal Eagle, and the Owl. Each character has specific skills. Then you explore the map where you can fight NPCs, pick up items and meet NPC to trade items.

(You are the red circle, the orange flash is a fight, the green pavilion is a NPC which you can trade items with, and the yellow star is an random item).



-	The second phase is the marketplace phase :
Congratulations ! You passed the first phase. Now to get stronger, you have 7 days(actions) can recruit allies, buy, sell or trade items with the trader. You can also take a nap to get quickly at the phase 3.

-	The final phase is the Final Boss fight : 
Tiger Hood shows up, you need to beat him, alone or with your team.

Comment : 
When we did the project, we hadn’t learn the class property in class, so we decided to make it harder by not using it.


Our game is playable on VsCode Terminal !
